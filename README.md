# What This Is #
A collection of `.txt` and `.png` files providing the output of various Cisco commands from (almost exclusively) IOS devices as well as step-by-step commands necessary to perform certain configuration tasks. The commands and related output are mostly taken from the Cisco Press books:

"Cisco CCNA Routing and Switching 200-125 Official Cert Guide" by Wendell Odom

"CCNP and CCIE Enterprise Core ENCOR 350-401 Official Cert Guide" by Brad Edgeworth, Kevin Wallace, David Hucaby, Jason Gooley, Ramiro Garza Rios

In some examples the command output is taken from devices configured in a production environment (with sanitized output).

# The Files #
All of the `.png` files were created using the Petrify app (https://www.dangercove.com/petrify/) on macOS. All `.png` files have a corresponding plaintext `.txt` file located in the `Plaintext` folders (depending on if it is a configuration task or specific command).

All `.png` files demonstrating command output are provided with a "Command Omitted" version showing just the output.
